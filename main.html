<h3><li>Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic.</li></h3>
<h3><li>The first confirmed case has been traced back to 17 November 2019 in Hubei.</li></h3>
<h3><li> The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVIDâ€‘19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC)on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, and loss of smell and taste.While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm,multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots.</li></h3>
<h3><li>The virus is primarily spread between people during close contact,most often via small droplets produced by coughing,sneezing, and talking.The droplets usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces rather than travelling through air over long distances.Transmission may also occur through smaller droplets that are able to stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Recommended measures to prevent infection include frequent hand washing, maintaining physical distance from others (especially from those with symptoms), quarantine (especially for those with symptoms), covering coughs, and keeping unwashed hands away from the face.</li></h3>
<h3><li>Sanitizing of frequently touched surfaces is also recommended or required by regulation for businesses and public facilities</li></h3>
