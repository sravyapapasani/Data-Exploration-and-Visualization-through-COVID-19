## Description

- The goal of this research is to explore and visualize the covid-19 data which mainly includes total conformed cases, deaths, discharged in corresponding states across the world. 
- The process of exploration and visualization is the collection of data in required format and visualizing the data through proper visualization techniques which makes the large collection of data to be more understandable.	
- The process of exploration and visualization is the collection of data in required format and visualizing the data through proper visualization techniques which makes the large collection of data to be more understandable.	
- After scraping the data , this data should be stored in CSV files.
- In google cloud platform, these CSV files are loaded into  BigQuery tables in particular dataset. 
- After the data is loaded into BigQuery tables, the data can be visualized in different visualization techniques in Google DataStudio platform by establishing the connection between Google cloud and  Google DataStudio.
